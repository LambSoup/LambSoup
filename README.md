- 👋 Hi, I’m @LambSoup
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to document and apply my skills from college English courses.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning technical writing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that needs help documenting.
- 📫 How to reach me ~ Discord: SlamSoap#5403 

Documenting: Includes, but not limited to, fixing typos, spelling errors, grammar, puncuation, tone, style, etc. 

I'm a newbie to coding, but I have, at least, taken a CS course where we used Javascript. I have also used HTML and some CSS in developing wikis for Fandom between the years of 2014-2019.
